While Dr.Welland has allowed us to submit our code as a .py file,
the magic command %timeit is not supported in a .py file.
Therefore, the equivalent module timeit is being used to approximate the time complexity.

    What can be observed from the resulting graph and the printed time values is that
    the sparse solver is significantly less computationally expensive than the dense solver
    for large values of N. However, it has a higher constant cost for very small values of N resulting in 
    significantly slower performance at lower N values. This behaviour is similar to what is seen
    in hash tables, where the constant cost of hashing the key is on average higher than the time it takes to
    search through a list of small N values(usually 7 in the case of hash tables and stack array iteration).
